Coding Test for Mobile

Overview: Implement a mobile application that retrieves information from a public API and displays it in an interactive way in the UI.

Goals:

- Build a functioning mobile application runnable in a simulator
- The application should retrieve data from a public API over HTTP(s) in XML or JSON type format
- The application should be able to interpret the data and display it in an interactive UI.
- The UI should be interactive and show basic navigation and interaction functionality

Example:
Map application that shows cafe's within a configurable range from your current location.  User enters a distance in a field, say 2 miles, and clicks a button.  The application retrieves a list of cafe's in a 2 mile range and shows the list.  Clicking on a cafe opens a window that shows the location on a map.

- Use Google Maps API: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html
- If you need an API key, let us know.

You don't have to use this example if you have another idea, feel free to propose it.

- What we'll be looking for beyond solid coding skills:
- Create UI with various widgets and navigation.
- Keep state
- Retrieve and process remote data
- Ability to create well written code that can easily be read/used/expanded upon by others.
- Creativity. Have a bit of fun with it.
- Feel free to show off in your area's you're good at!

You have up to 90 minutes to work on it.  Good luck! (not that you'll need it ;-)
